Level 0
I saw all the important key words like cat,ls,ls -a,mkdir,…on google first to learn them.
Made a directory using mkdir with name Bandit so that I can store all the passwords separately
Then used cd Bandit to enter into it.
I am saving all the passwords so I saved the first password as echo bandit0 > 0 so I saved it with name 0 so that if I  am lost I can retrieve any password back
After that I used sshpass -p $ (cat 0) ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Level 0  Level1
After entering I typed ls I got a file named readme  then to read the contents of it I typed cat readme  and I got the password.
Then typed exit and came out and then saved it as 1.
